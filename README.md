## 👋 About Me

❌ Tired of fragile releases, rising cloud costs, or noisy alerts?
You're not alone. Most teams ship tools—not reliable platforms.

Hi, I'm Saúl, a Freelance SRE/DevOps Cloud and Platform Engineer (AWS & Azure). Since 2020 I've owned production reliability, CI/CD, and Kubernetes for MatrixBooking and other teams—shipping fast without sacrificing security, cost control, or sleep.

### What I actually deliver (real-world, hands-on)

- IaC-first platforms with Terraform (multi-account AWS/Azure, repeatable, auditable)
- Kubernetes done right (EKS/AKS), secure networking, and sane release workflows
- CI/CD that flies (Bitbucket/GitLab/GitHub) with approvals, promos, and rollbacks
- Observability that matters (CloudWatch, Azure Monitor, Datadog) tied to SLOs
- Security + DR baked in (WAFv2, TLS, IAM/RBAC, RDS/Aurora backups, tested runbooks)

### If you're looking to

• Ship faster with multi-stage, gated deployments
• Migrate or containerize safely (EKS/AKS), zero-downtime where it counts
• Cut cloud spend without surprises (spot/on-demand mix, right-sizing, caching)
• Pass security reviews with confidence (policies, logging, least privilege)

Then I can help.
